# PlatformerGL

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to create a simple prototype for a platformer, my first real test 
to see if I can implement some game mechanics such as levels, basic physics, entities, entity managers,
custom level formats, cameras, and various other things into a game rendered using OpenGL. It certainly
taught me many lessons, which I will carry onto future projects.
